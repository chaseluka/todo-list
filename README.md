Project Overview
========

This is a task manager app, that allows a user to add, edit, complete, delete, and organize todo's. They are able to set priority's, notes, due date, as well as speicifying which project to list and view the todo in. A list of completed todo's is also availaible and todo's are saved via local broswer storage. 

This project aimed to practice OOP Principles like Single Resposibility Principle, SOLID Principles, and avoiding tightly coupled objects. I also utilized webpack and module importing/exporting extensively.
